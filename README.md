### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cole Croteau and I am currently going through my `5`th year of education at California State University progressing towards a bachelor's in computer engineering. I mainly work in C and Verilog but have dabbled in Java, Python, Assembly, and VHDL. The goal of this profile is to show you my past projects and get a grasp of how knowledgeable I am in different programming languages and concepts surrounding them. If you'd like to get to know more about me feel free to reach me at my email or Discord found below.
