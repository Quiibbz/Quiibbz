### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cole Croteau and I am currently going through my `4`th year of education at California State University progressing towards a bachelor's in computer engineering. I mainly work in Java and Verilog but have dabbled in C, Java, Python, Assembly, and VHDL. If you'd like to get to know more about me feel free to reach me at my email or Discord found below.
